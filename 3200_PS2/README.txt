Instructions for running my code:

-Unzip the directory and open it in Matlab
-All of the functions required to run the code are contained within

-Code for #1 is in Simpson_Integration.m
-Code for #2 and #3 is in Quadtx_Integration.m and depends on quadtx.m as well as modified_quadtx.m
-The writeup is in the separate PDF file: 3200_Assignment02.pdf

Thanks!
